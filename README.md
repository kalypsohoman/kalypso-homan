# My website

This is the code for my personal website. You can see it live at www.kalypsohoman.com. If you want to run it locally, download the repo and install dependencies with `npm install`. Then start up the server using:

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Stack

This project was built entirely in svelte. I used vercel to deploy it.
